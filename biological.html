          <p> Biological disasters are causative of process or phenomenon of organic origin or conveyed by biological vectors, including exposure to pathogenic micro-organisms, toxins and bioactive substances that may cause loss of life, injury, illness or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. Examples of biological disasters include outbreaks of epidemic diseases, plant or animal contagion, insect or other animal plagues and infestation. Biological disasters may be in the form of:-</p>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Epidemic</div>
          <p>
            Epidemic affecting a disproportionately large number of individuals within a population, community, or region at the same time, examples being Cholera, Plague, Japanese Encephalitis (JE)/Acute Encephalitis  Syndrome (AES).An epidemic is when an unusually large number of people in a community get a disease at the same time. Examples of epidemic diseases include typhus, influenza, the Black Death, malaria, and smallpox. 
          </p>
          <p>Infected food and water - One way an epidemic can begin is if the food or water gets infected with a disease. If the local water supply of a city gets infected, then a number of people of the city will become sick, starting an epidemic. Increased virulence of the disease - Sometimes the pathogen (germ) that causes a disease may change and become more virulent. This means that it can more easily infect people and make them sick.</p>
          <p>Introduction of a new disease - Many epidemics begin when a new disease is introduced to a population. This occurred when the Europeans brought smallpox to the Americas killing as much as 90% of the native population. Lower resistance to a disease - Sometimes famine and poor nutrition can cause a population to have lower resistance to a disease causing an epidemic. Natural disasters and wars - Natural disasters and wars can trigger the start of epidemics by causing infected water, bringing in new diseases, and lowering the resistance to disease of the population.</p>
          <p>Insects - Insects can carry diseases and transmit them from person to person. Examples of insect-borne diseases include the bubonic plague and malaria. Airborne transmission - Infection can also travel through the air, usually when a person coughs or sneezes. Examples of airborne diseases include influenza, measles, and tuberculosis. Foods and water - Some diseases can be spread through infected food or water. Examples include cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever.</p>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Pandemic</div>
          <p>A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease.</p>
            <p>An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza virus emerges and spreads around the world, and most people do not have immunity. Viruses that have caused past pandemics typically originated from animal influenza viruses.</p>
            <p>Some aspects of influenza pandemics can appear similar to seasonal influenza while other characteristics may be quite different. For example, both seasonal and pandemic influenza can cause infections in all age groups, and most cases will result in self-limited illness in which the person recovers fully without treatment. However, typical seasonal influenza causes most of its deaths among the elderly while other severe cases occur most commonly in people with a variety of medical conditions.</p>
            <p>By contrast, this H1N1 pandemic caused most of its severe or fatal disease in younger people, both those with chronic conditions as well as healthy persons, and caused many more cases of viral pneumonia than is normally seen with seasonal influenza.</p>
            <p>For both seasonal and pandemic influenza, the total number of people who get severely ill can vary. However, the impact or severity tends to be higher in pandemics in part because of the much larger number of people in the population who lack pre-existing immunity to the new virus. When a large portion of the population is infected, even if the proportion of those infected that go on to develop severe disease is small, the total number of severe cases can be quite large.</p>
            <p>For both seasonal and pandemic influenza, the highest levels of activity would be expected to occur in the usual influenza season period for an area. (In the temperate climate zones, this is usually the winter months, for example). But as was seen with the current H1N1 pandemic, pandemics can have unusual epidemiological patterns and large outbreaks can occur in the summer months.</p>
