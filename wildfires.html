          <p>A forest fire is a natural disaster consisting of a fire which destroys a forested area, and can be a great danger to people who live in forests as well as wildlife. Forest fires are generally started by lightning, but also by human negligence or arson, and can burn thousands of square kilometers.</p>
          <p>Forest fires, also known as wildfires, vegetation fire, grass fire, brush fire or bush fire, is common in vegetated areas of Australia, South Africa, United States and Canada, where climates are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of trees, but feature extended hot and dry periods.</p>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead">What Causes Forest Fires?</div>
          <div class="alllist">

          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px; color: #16390E" >Natural Causes:- </strong></ul>
          <ul>Lightning is the biggest natural cause of forest fires. The different lightning strokes of varied electric voltages cause fire through directly igniting vegetation with high currents. Lightning fires are always more common immediately after dry seasons when vegetation is still dry. Lightning fires destroy more vegetation than human-caused fires. This is because lighting fires occur in remote areas far from human presence and are not notice in time, unlike fires caused by human activities. Lightning caused fires also occur in rough terrains and dangerous places which makes it hard for fire suppression equipment and personnel to reach the fire on time.</ul><ul> Volcanic activities such as eruptions and lava flow can cause fires which are difficult to put out because of the lava flow and other associated risks. In most cases, firefighters try to create a buffer zone where they can manage the fires. Spontaneous combustion of dry leaves and vegetation may also be responsible for some fire outbreaks.</ul>
          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px; color: #16390E" >Human Causes:- </strong></ul>
          <ul>Human activities near or within forested areas are the number one cause of forest fires. Smoking near vegetation can cause a widespread fire when a smoker throws a cigarette into vegetation without completely extinguishing its burning butt. While most smokers throw lit cigarettes innocently, their actions have caused several forest fires throughout history. Some fires may take a few hours before being noticed as the fire starts small and spreads slowly at first before gaining momentum. Equipment such as machinery used in logging and hunting can also cause fires. Bullets hitting on some dry vegetation may result in fires. Petroleum products used in logging equipment can cause fires when there is a leak onto the vegetation. Other causes include campfires that are not well monitored or put off entirely. Electric faults from facilities or electricity plants near forests can also cause fires. In some extreme cases, people have deliberately caused fires during hunting to corner wild animals while others burn forests to clear the way for agriculture or development activities. Lastly, some people just start fires without any reason (arson). Up to 90% of forest fires in the US are caused by humans.</ul>
          </div>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Prevention </div>
          <div class="alllist">
          <ul>Most natural fires are usually monitored and allowed to burn, with the aim of balancing a forest's ecology. Vegetation may also be burned occasionally in order to balance species. Authorities have undertaken awareness campaigns on the causes of fires to reduce human initiated fire incidences. In some cases, firefighters burn sections of forest vegetation to control possible fires in the future by creating buffer zones. Wildfire suppression can be done in various ways. Simple techniques such as throwing layers of soil can be used. In some cases, unmanned aerial planes can be used to drop water and fire retardants.</ul>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Effects of Wildfires </div>
          <div class="alllist">

          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px; color: #16390E" >1. Loss of Ecosystems and Biodiversity:- </strong></ul><ul>Wildfires destroy the habitats and the intricate relationships of diverse flora and fauna leading to loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. Wildfires simply damage the habitable and adaptable land for specific animal and plant species. It alters or kills the plant life features which support thousands of wildlife thereby forcing the animals out of the regions or even killing them.</ul> 
          <ul>Smaller and rare animals including birds, squirrels, insects, rabbits, and snakes are mainly at high risks of death, whereas some plant species are burnt to ashes. Besides, wildfires can even lead to extinction for certain animals.</ul>
          <ul>Wildfires can be so severe that they decimate the habits and critical relationships of plants and animals causing loss of ecosystem. Most animals are able to detect oncoming fires and migrate early. Those that can’t move faster are killed. Since plant life that supports life in the area is burnt down, animals have to look for habitats elsewhere.</ul>
          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px;color: #16390E">2. Forest Degradation :- </strong></ul>
          <ul>Forest fires such as the ones that commonly happen in dry tropical forests are a major cause of forest degradation. Whenever forest fires are experienced, thousands of acres of trees and vegetation cover are wiped out. Almost every year, forests fires are witnessed across different forest regions which persistently reduce the quality of certain forest features like soil fertility, biodiversity, and ecosystems.</ul>
          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px;color: #16390E">3. Air Pollution:- </strong></ul>
          <ul>We all know that living plant matter purifies the atmospheric air we depend on for respiration. They achieve this by taking in carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases, and air impurities and later give off oxygen. When plant life is exterminated by fires, the quality of air we breathe in declines and greenhouse gasses increase in the atmosphere leading to climate change and global warming. In addition, the huge clouds of smoke instigated by wildfires lead to massive air pollution.</ul>
          <ul>Trees and vegetation covers act as purifiers of the air we breathe by absorbing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as well as other air impurities and gives out oxygen. When they are burned down, it means more greenhouse gases increases in the atmosphere, resulting in global warming. Furthermore, huge amounts of smoke and dust are discharged into the atmosphere, causing air pollution.</ul>
          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px;color: #16390E">4. Soil Degradation:- </strong></ul>
          <ul>Forest soils are loaded with nutrients emanating from decaying forest debris. Forest soils also consist of numerous natural features that support a plethora of life forms and organic activities. Wildfires also kill beneficial soil microorganisms that are responsible for breaking down the soil and promoting soil microbial activities. The burning of trees and vegetation cover also leaves the soil bare making it readily vulnerable to soil erosion. The high temperature caused by wildfires destroys almost the entire nutritive value of the soil.</ul>
          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px;color: #16390E">5. Economic Losses:- </strong></ul>
          <ul>Many have witnessed firefighters battling wildfire on TV. This could give you a rough idea of the damage wildfires can cause to the vegetation and wildlife. Wildfires devastate everything in their path including property. On top of that, local authorities spend millions of dollars to put out or control the fire. An army of firefighters is normally deployed to extinguish raging fires. Airplanes are deployed to drops huge liters of water and phosphate fertilizer from high above, not to mention the truck and logistics involved. All these costs money and the area could suffer economically moving forward.</ul>
          <ul><strong style="font-size: 20px;color: #16390E">6. Economic Losses:- </strong></ul>
          <ul>Trees and vegetation cover acts as watershed protectors since approximately all the water comes from forest-derived water tables. Whenever they burn, the natural protection systems for water tables, streams, and rivers may be affected.</ul>
          </div>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Impacts to Human Well-being and Health </div>
          <div class="alllist">
          <ul>Wildfires have contributed to some fatalities, especially impacting firefighters and lifesavers. The effect of smoke and dust also causes intense breathing discomfort and can worsen the health of people with allergies and respiratory disorders.</ul>
          <ul>Although wildfires cause a lot of destruction and loss of lives, they have a few benefits too. The old vegetation burnt down allows new ones to spring up. There is always remarkable growth after a wildfire. Some tree species have their seeds opened and thrown to ash-enriched soils and begin to grow. For example, the Jack pine’s cones open when exposed to intense heat from the fire and drop seeds into the ash-enriched soil. So, when the Jackpine dies in the fires, new ones grow.</ul>
          <ul>Wildfires also promote flowering and fruiting of some plant species. This is because wood ash is one of the best fertilizers around. Wood ash contains just about every nutrient plants need including magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Ash also contain carbonates that help neutralize acidic soils to allow healthy growth of plants.</ul>
          <ul>The destructive effects of wildfires can be mitigated by being responsible when handling aspects that could trigger any fire and reporting early when you witness any nature-instigated fire.</ul></div>
