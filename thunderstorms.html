          <p> Thunderstorms occur round the year in different parts of the country. However, its frequency and intensity is maximum in summer months (March to June). As the most important factor for occurrence of thunderstorm is the intense heating of the atmosphere at surface level and maximum heating takes place in summer months, the frequency of occurrence is maximum in summer months.</p>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead">Classification of Thunderstorms</div>
          <div class="alllist">

          <p><strong style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family:nyala; ">A. Thunderstorm :- </strong></p> <ul>Is said to have occurred, if the thunder is heard. Usually the thunder can be heard up to a distance of 40 km from the source of origin. Thunderstorms fall in the category of Meso-gamma weather systems with spatial extent of around 2~20 km and temporal scale of a few hours. Considering the intensity, the thunderstorms in India are categorised as moderate and severe thunderstorms as follows.</ul>
          <ul><strong>Moderate thunderstorm : </strong>
            <li> It is called as moderate thunderstorm, if there is loud peals of thunder with frequent lightning flashes, moderate to Strong rains and maximum wind speed 29 to 74 kmph</li></ul>
            <ul><strong>Severe thunderstorm : </strong>
              <li>It is called as severe thunderstorm, if there is continuous thunder and lightning, Strong rains and maximum wind speed ≥ 75 kmph </li></ul>

              <p><strong style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family:nyala; ">B. Squall :- </strong></p>
              <ul>The climatology of spatial distribution of occurrence of squall is almost same as that of thunderstorms. The frequency and intensity of squall are maximum over eastern and northeastern states. Comparing different seasons, the frequency of squall is maximum in pre-monsoon season (March-May) in different parts of the country. However, there is a secondary maximum in the winter season over the northwest India. The intensity of squall is also maximum in the month of May followed by April. A squall is defined as a sudden increase of wind speed by at least 29 kmph (16 knots) with the speed  ising to 40 kmph (22 knots) or more and lasting for at least one minute. The squalls are of two types: </ul>
              <ul><strong>Moderate squall: </strong> It is called as moderate squall, if surface wind speed(in gusts) is upto 80 kmph</ul>
              <ul><strong>Severe squall:</strong>It is called as severe squall, if surface wind speed ( in gusts) is greater than 80 kmph </ul>
              <p><strong style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family:nyala; ">C. Hailstorm :- </strong></p>
              <ul>India is among the countries in the world with the highest frequency of hail. There are about 29 hail days per year of moderate to severe intensity. About 25% of total occurrence in the past recorded hailstones of 3-cm or more diameter. The hailstorms are mainly observed in the winter and pre-monsoon seasons with virtually no events after the onset of the southwest monsoon. </ul><ul>The hail appears to be associated with a particular cell of convective cloud rather than storm as a whole. Hail occurs in mature stage, if at all it occurs. Cells in which hails occur have updrafts of greater than average intensity, exceeding 15 meter per second. Hailstorms are of three types: </ul>
              <ul><strong>Slight Hailstorm: </strong> It is called as slight hailstorm, if it is sparsely distributed, usually small in size and often mixed with rain</ul>
              <ul><strong>Moderate Hailstorm:</strong>It is called as moderate hailstorm, of it is abundant enough to whiten ground  </ul>
              <ul><strong>Strong Hailstorm:</strong>It is called as Strong hailstorm, if it includes at least a roportion of large stones  </ul>
              <p><strong style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family:nyala; ">D. Dust storm:- </strong></p>
              <ul>The northwest India experiences convective dust storms called “aandhi” locally during the pre-monsoon season. The frequency of dust storm is maximum over Rajasthan followed by Haryana, Punjab and west UP. The dust storm mainly occurs in the pre-monsoon season and it is maximum in the month of May in terms of frequency and intensity. </ul>
              <p><strong style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family:nyala; ">E. Lightning :- </strong></p>
              <ul>Lightning is a high-energy luminous electrical discharge from a thundercloud to the ground accompanied by thunder. In the atmosphere, three types of discharges take place: </ul>
              <ul>1) Thundercloud (intra-cloud), </ul>
              <ul>2) One cloud to another (inter-cloud) </ul>
              <ul>3) Cloud to ground (CG). </ul>
              <ul>The third type of lightning takes a toll on life and property and so is of more concern to us. Aircrafts can be hit by inter cloud and intra-cloud lightning. Lightning is a high-current electric discharge that occurs in the earth atmosphere and that has total path length on the order of few kilometers. The peak power and total energy in lightning are very high, the peak power that is dissipated by a lightning discharge is on the order of 100 million watts per meter of channel and the peak channel temperature approach 30,000 °C. Peak currents in a lightning discharge range from several to hundreds of kiloamperes (kA), with typical value being 40 kA. Prediction of lightning as to the precise time and location is very difficult or impossible. However, somewhat a season or period of lightning occurrence at many regions is known. </ul></div>
              <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead">Impact of Thunderstorm/Lightning, Dust/Hailstorm, Squall, and Strong wind in India</div>
              <p>In India every year more than 2500 people die due to lightning (Source: Annual Report, NCRB). Maharashtra has highest deaths due to lightning in India. Mostly Rural and forest areas are vulnerable with tall trees and water bodies. Majority of the lightning victims are the people working on the field in rural area. For example, a study of lightning deaths over Maharashtra has shown that 86% of the total deaths (Source: IITM, Pune: 2004-2009) are from people working on the field. Lightning is also a major cause of electrical power breakdowns, and forest fires. It can also cause damages to communication and computer equipment, and aircrafts. IMD data (1950- 1980) show that annual thunderstorm frequency more than 80 thunderstorm days per year occurs over North eastern part of India, some part of Kerala and some part of Jammu-Kashmir. The eastern and northeastern parts of our country i.e Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkahand, Bihar, Orissa, and States in NE India get affected by severe thunderstorms during pre-monsoon months of March to May.</p>
