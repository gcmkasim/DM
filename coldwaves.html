          <p> A cold wave (known in some regions as a cold snap or cold spell) is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. A cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year.</p>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Cold Waves Effects</div>
          <p>
            A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of hypothermia or starvation. They often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmers.
          </p>
          <p>Weather scientists claim that extreme weather events will be increasingly palpable, throwing life out of gear, more often now than before. Cold waves too fall under such extreme events, which can severely and fatally affect the very young, the elderly and the infirm. Occurrences of extreme low temperature in association with incursion of dry cold winds from north into the sub-continent are defined as cold waves. A region is said to be experiencing a cold wave when, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), temperatures dip by more than four degrees below normal. The northern parts of India especially the hilly regions and the adjoining plains are influenced by transient disturbances in the mid latitude westerlies, known as western.association with large amplitude troughs, cold wave conditions are sometimes reported from states like Maharashtra and Karnataka as well. The maximum number of cold waves occur in Jammu and Kashmir followed by Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.</p>

          <p>In India the Western Himalayas and adjoining northern parts experience cloudiness and precipitation in association with WD during winter. Mostly WD is a double edged sword that on one end plays an important role in bringing relief in extreme weather conditions, while on the other can also be responsible for that very same extreme climate. These are aptly named western disturbances as they enter India through the western region in the form of a trough in the upper and middle tropospheric westerlies and join the monsoons, cyclones and severe thunderstorms in modulating weather over the Indian mainland. They occasionally deepen after entering the Indo-Pak area, particularly over Rajasthan and Punjab. The intensification is the combined effect of incursion of moist air from the Arabian Sea (or sometimes from the Bay of Bengal) and the orography of the region. A WD originates usually over the Mediterranean/Black Sea as an extratropical frontal system, but its frontal characteristics are lost while moving eastward towards India across Afghanistan/Pakistan. As they re-organise and intensify upon approaching India, their moist air streams slow down and start ascending over the southern slopes of the Himalayas. About two to three systems are known to annually traverse northwest India. All weather patterns, however, have a self-controlling mechanism, which ensures that they normalise after some time.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Stay indoors as much as possible.</li>
              <li>Check that you have adequate winter clothing.</li>
              <li>Monitor all media outlets for weather and emergency procedure information.</li>
              <li>Check on any neighbours who live alone, especially the elderly.</li>
              <li>Ensure emergency supplies are easily accessible-no power means-no electricity.</li>
              <li>Use only one room-an internal room or passage will be easier to heat. Regular hot drinks will maintain body heat to fight the cold.</li>
              <li>If electricity fails, freezers will preserve food for up to 48 hours if the door is kept shut.</li>
              <li>Ensure that adequate clothing is worn-many light layers are better than one thick layer.</li>
              <li>Hats and mufflers help to prevent heat loss.</li>
              <li>Maintain proper ventilation when using kerosene heater or coal oven to avoid toxic fumes.</li>
              <li>Eat healthy food to supply heat to the body and drink non alcoholic beverages.</li>
