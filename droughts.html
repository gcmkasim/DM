          <p> Drought is a natural hazard that differs from other hazards since it has a slow onset, evolves over months or even years, affects a large spatial extent, and cause little structural damage. Its onset and end and severity are often difficult to determine. Like other hazards, the impacts of drought span  conomic, environmental and social sectors and can be reduced through mitigation and preparedness. Because droughts are a normal part of climate variability for virtually all regions, it is important to develop plans to deal with these extended periods of water shortage in a timely, systematic manner as they evolve. Experience has shown that the democratic from of governance has handled droughts more efficiently than others, as demonstrated by the situation in India before and after independence.</p>
          <p>Drought conditions have been widespread in North Africa, the Mid-East, West Asian countries, India, China and have also known to occur in North Central, and South America. The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, heat/ cold waves, cyclones, delayed or early onset of rains, long dry spells, early withdrawal, during the last two decades has been attribute to global warming.</p>
          <p>Drought in India occurs in areas with high as well as regions with meagre rainfall. Water scarcity conditions in the Himalayan region are also not uncommon. Drought is no longer mere scarcity or the absence of rainfall, but related to inefficient water resource management. Requirement of over 80-90 % of the drinking water and over 50 % for irrigation is met from groundwater. The control of this resource is with the owner of land. Water is being over exploited and not harvested. Without effective and large scale rainwater harvesting, only limited recharge is taking place. Analysis of incidence of droughts over the last two centuries in India does not show any increase in the incidence of droughts in recent years. However, their severity appears to have increased. India in 2002 experienced its worst drought in 20 years. However the probability of drought in India varies from once in 2 years in Western Rajasthan to once in 15 years in Assam.</p>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Drought Risk</div>
          <p>
            Drought vulnerability is a product of a region's risk of water shortage and the exposure of the communities to the problems arising thereafter. If nations and regions are to make progress in reducing the serious consequences of drought, they must improve their understanding of the hazard and the factors that influence vulnerability. It is critical for countries to better understand this hazard and how it varies temporally and spatially to establish comprehensive and integrated drought early warning systems that ncorporate climate, soil, and water supply functions such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, snow pack, reservoir and lake levels, ground water levels, and stream flow.

            <ul><p>Drought conditions can lead to insufficient supplies of water for drinking, household usage, fire suppression, agriculture. Water sources, including reservoirs, groundwater, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, can be greatly impacted, and can result in loss of water supply, crop damage, and significant effects on the environment.</p><p>Before and during a drought, taking steps to reduce water usage both inside and outside your home can help conserve water and minimize impacts to availability of water supplies. Efforts for conserving water should be made by both consumers of municipal water supplies, as well as private well owners.</p><p>The Stateâ€™s Drought Management Task Force evaluates drought conditions and impacts, and provides recommendations to the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs on classifying drought levels for the various regions of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has six drought regions (West, Connecticut River, Central, Northeast, Southeast and Cape/Islands), and the following five drought level classifications:</p>
              <li>Normal (normal to slightly dry conditions)</li>
              <li>Advisory (abnormally dry conditions)</li>
              <li>Watch (excessively dry conditions)</li>

            <ul><strong style="color: #F95300">Indoor Water Conservation Tips Prior to a Drought</strong>
              <li>Never pour water down the drain when there may be another use for it. For example, use it to water your indoor plants or garden. </li>
            <li>Repair dripping faucets by replacing washers. One drop per second wastes 2,700 gallons of water per year.</li>
            <li>Check all plumbing for leaks and have any leaks repaired by a plumber.</li>
            <li>Retrofit all household faucets by installing aerators with flow restrictors.</li>
            <li>Install an instant hot water heater on your sink.</li>
            <li>Insulate your water pipes to reduce heat loss and prevent them from breaking.</li>
            <li>Install a water-softening system only when the minerals in the water would damage your pipes. Turn the softener off while on vacation.</li>
            <li>Choose appliances that are more water and energy efficient.</li>
            <li>Install a low-volume toilet that uses less than half the water of older models. Note: In some areas, low-volume units are required by law.</li>
            <li>For toilets with larger water tanks, install a toilet displacement device to reduce the amount of water needed to flush.</li>
            <li>Replace your showerhead with an ultra-low-flow version.</li>
            <li>Reduce use of sink disposals, which require a lot of water to operate properly. Instead, start a compost pile as an alternate method of disposing of food waste or simply dispose of food in the garbage.</li></ul>
            <ul><strong style="color: #F95300">Outdoor Water Conservation Tips Prior to a Drought</strong></ul>
            <ul>
            <li>Plant native and/or drought-tolerant grasses, ground covers, shrubs, and trees, or small plants. Small plants require less water to become established. Group plants together based on similar water needs.</li>
            <li>Leave grass clippings on lawn to shade and return nutrients to soil.</li>
            <li>Avoid purchasing recreational water toys that require a constant stream of water.</li>
            <li>Avoid installing ornamental water features (such as fountains) unless they use re-circulated water.</li>
            <li>Consider using rainwater collection systems to water plants and gardens.</li>
            <li>Avoid over-fertilizing your lawn. Applying fertilizer increases the need for water.</li>
            <li>Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants to reduce evaporation and keep the soil cool. Organic mulch also improves the soil and prevents weeds.</li>
            <li>Do not wash your car by handheld hose.</li></ul>
