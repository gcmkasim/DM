        	<div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Cyclone Gaja forms in Bay of Bengal, severe cyclonic storm in next 24 hours </div>

	<p>As predicted, the deep depression in Bay of Bengal has finally intensified into the cyclonic storm Gaja and is presently marked over East central and adjoining West central and Southeast Bay of Bengal. </p>
	<p>Moving in west-northwestwards, the system is centered around Latitude 13.4°N and Longitude 89.3°E, around 390 km west-northwest of Port Blair, 990 km northeast of Chennai and 1050 km east-southeast of Nellore.</p>
<div class="pimages" style="text-align: center;"> <img src="gphoto\cyclone-gaja.jpg" width="750px"></div>

	<p>According to weathermen, the system is moving in extremely favourable conditions for its further intensification. Gaja is most likely to get more marked into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours.</p>
	<p>As per Skymet Weather, there is long sea travel ahead for Gaja, along with that sea surface temperatures are also warm and low vertical wind shear. Besides this, Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is also in the favourable zone. All these factors would be responsible in providing more strength to the system.</p>
	<p>Weather models are indicating that the cyclonic storm would continue to track west-northwestwards during the next 36 hours. Thereafter, it would change the direction and move west-southwest wards towards the coasts of North Tamil Nadu and South Andhra Pradesh during the subsequent 48 hours.</p>
	<p>Usually, majority of the weather systems forming in Bay of Bengal during November head towards Tamil Nadu. However, as the system nears the coast, it would start weakening gradually. However, the system would make landfall as a cyclone. Gaja is likely to cross the North Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh coasts by the forenoon of November 15.</p>
	<p>As of now the system is quite far away from the Indian mainland to give any weather over the region. However, Andaman and Nicobar Islands are likely to record fairly widespread rainfall with some heavy spells as well.</p>
	<p>Sea conditions would remain rough to very rough during this this time and fishermen are not advised to venture out in the sea. Scattered rains will commence over Chennai and coastal Tamil Nadu around November 14. As the system nears, intensity would also rise, and we expect heavy to very heavy rains over the area on November 15.</p>
	<p>Intensity of rains would start decreasing by November 16, but many districts of Tamil Nadu and South Interior Karnataka would continue with good rains.</p>
	<p>Sea conditions will become rough to very rough from November 13-16 over southwest Bay of Bengal off Tamil Nadu and south Andhra coast. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the sea during this time.</p>
