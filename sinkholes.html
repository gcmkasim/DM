          <h3 style="font-family: nyala">What is a sinkhole? <div class="line" style="width: 100%"> </div> </h3>
                    
          <p> A sinkhole is essentially any hole in the ground created by erosion and the drainage of water. They can be just a few feet across or large enough to swallow whole buildings. Although they’re often the result of natural processes they can also be triggered by human activity.There are two basic types, those that are created slowly over time (a cover-subsidence sinkhole) and those that appear suddenly (a cover-collapse sinkhole). Naturally, it’s the latter type that create headlines, but both varieties are formed by the same basic mechanism.</p>

          </div> 
          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> What causes them?</div>
          <p>
            Sinkholes mainly occur in what is known as ‘karst terrain’; areas of land where soluble bedrock (such as limestone or gypsum) can be dissolved by water. With cover-subsidence sinkholes the bedrock becomes exposed and is gradually worn down over time, with the holes often becoming ponds as the water fills them in.</p>
          <p>With a cover-collapse sinkhole this same process occurs out of sight. Naturally occurring cracks and small voids underneath the surface are hollowed out by water erosion, with a cover of soil or sediment remaining over the top. Eventually, as the hole expands this cover can no longer support its own weight and suddenly collapses to reveal the cavern underneath.</p>
          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Why are there so many sinkholes now?</div>
          <p>Most of the sinkholes we are seeing at the moment are at least indirectly created by human activity. They're occuring just to the sides of human constructions where rain water has been concentrated on a particular patch of ground in the form of run-off from roofs and tarmac.</p>
          <p>However, these local factors wouldn't matter if it wasn't for the wider picture. The South East (where most of the sinkholes have appeared) has not only suffered one of the wettest winters in recent decades, but is also natural sinkhole country - most of the bedrock is the soluble chalk.</p>

          <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> WHere are signs to watch for that may indicate a problem:</div>
          <div class="alllist">
          <ul><li>Trees or fence posts that tilt or fall.</li>
            <li>New small ponds that appear after rain.</li>
            <li>Cracks in the ground.</li>
            <li>Sudden drainage of a pond.</li>
            <li>Rapid appearance of a hole in the ground.</li>
            <li>Dips, depressions, slopes that appear in a yard.</li></ul>
            </div>

            <div style="font-family:nyala" class="phead"> Sinkholes now spread to more villages in Kadapa</div>
            <p>The mysterious formation of huge sinkholes with deafening noise in three villages in Chintakommadinne mandal of Kadapa district has spread to three more villages in the mandal, spreading fear among villagers.</p>
            <p>Even as the Geological Survey of India officials are analysing the causes for the phenomenon in Nayanoripalle and Peddamusalreddipalle and near Sri Bugga Malleswara Swamy temple in Chintakommadinne mandal a fortnight ago, the emergence of fresh sinkholes in Goodavandlapalle, Buggaletipalle and Buggalapalle in the mandal is giving sleepless nights to its residents.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, officials plunged into action on the orders of Kadapa District Collector K.V. Ramana and evacuated people from Nayanoripalle and Peddamusalreddipalle following the formation of sinkholes of a diameter of 25 feet. Land sunk, forming 15 feet-wide and seven-feet deep circular sinkholes at four places in Buggaletipalle and Buggalapalle villages in Chintakommadinne mandal on Sunday.</p>
            <p>A farmer, Rasool Reddy, who got his field ploughed with a tractor on Saturday, was baffled finding a large sinkhole of 20 feet diameter filled with water on Sunday. Three similar sinkholes were formed in the banana plantation in Takkoli Lakshmipathi Reddy, damaging drip irrigation equipment and engulfing nearly 40 banana plants. Chintakommadinne Tahsildar Gunabhushan Reddy and MPDO Ramachandra Reddy examined the sinkholes along with a surveyor.</p>
